# A Comparison Between Rreinforcement Learning Algorithms
Different reinforcement learning algorithm has its own pros and cons. 
A suitable algorithm can largely benefit the program. 
This work compares tabular methods and approximate methods. 

## Introduction
**Reinforcement learning** is about to **maximize the reward and without knowing the environment model**.
Therefore, various methods are created to enable the agent to value its policies, 
adjust them, and finally, converge to the optimal solution. 

When facing a specific problem, there are several aspects we should
consider, before we make our final decision. 
First of all, the state space and action space volume. Then the
type of the environment. 
For instance, whether it is discrete or statistic. Last but not least, the convergence
of each algorithm. 
A comprehensive decision could augment the efficiency of the program.
